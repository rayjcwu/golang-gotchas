		// call a function that returns (int, error); since err isn't declared yet
		// we use := for mixed declared and undeclared variables
		foo, err := getValue(2000)
		display(foo, err) // print out value; 2000 as expected

	fmt.Println("----")

	// Okay. What's happening here is that := prefers to declare over assign
	// variables. That means if you try to use it in a block it's going to shadow
	// all your external variables.

	// In order to maintain your previously declared variables you need to
	// explicitly declare the block-scoped variables:

	display(foo, nil) // still starting at 1000
	if true {
		var err error             // declare within the block
		foo, err = getValue(3000) // now this is only assignment
		display(foo, err)         // displays the expected 3000
	}

	// And now, because we didn't use := above, foo retains 3000
	display(foo, nil)

	fmt.Println("----")

	// This is surprising as typical, same-scope, use of := for declaration &
	// assignment will actually have the expected behavior with the existing
	// variable assigned and the new variable declared. This behavior is shown
	// below.

	baz := 1000 // declare a new variable
	display(baz, nil)

	baz, err := getValue(4000) // use := to for mixed declaration & assignment
	display(baz, err)          // and baz is updated as expected

	// Output:
	// (1000, <nil>)
	// (2000, <nil>)
	// (1000, <nil>)
	// ----
	// (1000, <nil>)
	// (3000, <nil>)
	// (3000, <nil>)
	// ----
	// (1000, <nil>)
	// (4000, <nil>)
