	// ...it almost behaves as expected; we get a panic but it also partially
	// works. So why?
	//
	// Look at the test function which worked and observe that it does not
	// depend on any internal state of the (nil) struct. Now recall how structs
	// are maintained basically as a <type, value> pair (see the nil_interfaces
	// gotcha).
	//
	// Taken together it's possible to call a method on a nil *value* as long
	// as the *type* of nil is known. As an example:
	s2 = nil // (yes, I know it's already nil; just making a point)
	fmt.Printf("calling a function on %s: %s\n", s2, s2.SameString())
	fmt.Println()

	// now that we've established it's legit to call methods on nil structs
	// we need to watch out for cases where we get called on nil or
	s2.MyString() // we panic...

	// I think in practice this isn't a huge deal but it does mean it's
	// potentially dangerous to assume that your host struct will have any
	// meaning when writing some method on a pointer to the struct. I'm
	// unclear what best practices are here.

	// Output:
	// i == nil? true
	//     caught runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
	//
	// s1: {this is s1}
	//   same string: same string
	//   my string:   this is s1
	//
	// s2: &{this is s2}
	//   same string: same string
	//   my string:   this is s2
	//
	// s2: <nil>
	//   same string: same string
	//     caught runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference

	// calling a function on %!s(*golanggotchas_test.S=<nil>): same string
